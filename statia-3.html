				<p>Trying to lose weight? Want to pack on more lean muscle mass? We've got you covered. Not only will the foods below help you trim down, they'll help ward off obesity-related diseases like metabolic syndrome and diabetes, too!</p>
				<p><strong>1. Eggs</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-1.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Just one egg contains about 15 percent of the day's riboflavin. It's just one of eight B vitamins, which all help the body to convert food into fuel, which in turn is used to produce energy. Another reason we love this protein? They've been shown to aid fat loss.</p>
				<p>In one eight-week study, people ate a breakfast of either eggs or bagels, which contained the same amount of calories. The egg group lost 65 percent more body weight, 16 percent more body fat, experienced a 61 percent greater reduction in BMI and saw a 34 percent greater reduction in waist circumference! For even more health benefits of eggs, check out these benefits of eggs.</p>
				<p><strong>2. Grass-Fed Beef</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-2.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>If you're go-to source of protein is beef, be sure to pick up the grass-fed variety. Why? Grass-fed beef has the holy trifecta of muscle building: It's the #1 food source of creatine, which increases muscle mass by speeding protein to muscles; it's rich in CLA, an anti-inflammatory fatty acid; and it provides more than one-half the recommended daily intake of protein in a four-ounce serving. An added bonus: It's naturally leaner and has fewer calories than conventional meat: A lean seven-ounce conventional strip steak has 386 calories and 16 grams of fat. But a seven-ounce grass-fed strip steak has only 234 calories and five grams of fat.</p>
				<p><strong>3. Quinoa</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-3.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>A particularly grueling workout can feel like a round in the boxing ring against a heavyweight champ, but quinoa is your ropes. Rely on this complete protein to help you rebound faster and come back stronger thanks to its slow-burning complex carbs, notable protein content and rich levels of lysine, an amino acid that aids tissue and muscle repair. What's more, quinoa is a rich source of minerals including magnesium, which helps relax the blood vessels and improve blood circulation to your muscles. All that adds up to a noticeably more defined, stronger you. To keep your taste buds interested, use the grain as a salad topper, mix it with oatmeal, add it to an omelet.</p>
				<p><strong>4. Chocolate Milk</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-4.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Drinking a combination of carbohydrates and protein after a hard workout can help restore your energy and aid in building lean, metabolism-boosting muscle, but it turns out that you don't need a fancy recovery beverage to reap these benefits. After participating in a vigorous cycling session, cyclists who drank chocolate milk were able to ride 51 percent longer in a subsequent workout than those who drank a standard recovery beverage, an article in Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism found. Plus, chocolate milk is cheaper (and tastier) than anything you'll find in a sports nutrition store.</p>
				<p><strong>5. Almonds</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-5.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Think of each almond as a natural weight-loss pill. A study of overweight and obese adults found that combined with a calorie-restricted diet, consuming a little more than a quarter cup of the nuts can decrease weight more effectively than a snack comprised of complex carbohydrates and safflower oil—after just two weeks! (And after 24 weeks, those who ate the nuts experienced a 62 percent greater reduction in weight and BMI!)</p>
				<p>For optimal results, eat your daily serving before you hit the gym. A study printed in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that almonds, rich in the amino acid L-arginine, can actually help you burn more fat and carbs during workouts. For even more ways to scorch those extra calories, check out these ways to boost your metabolism!</p>
				<p><strong>6. Grapefruit</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-6.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Like a marathoner stretching before the big run, eating half a grapefruit before a meal can enhance your body's fat-burning performance. A study published in the journal Metabolism found that this "warm-up" tactic can help whittle your middle—by up to an inch—in just six weeks!</p>
				<p>The scientists attribute the powerful effects to the grapefruits' fat-zapping phytochemicals. The fruit can interact negatively with certain medications, so as long as you get the green-light from your M.D, plan to have half of a grapefruit before your morning meal and add a few segments your starter salads to reap the benefits. For even more ways to eat yourself lean, check out these healthy breakfast ideas.</p>
				<p><strong>7. Pork</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-7.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>A longtime enemy of doctors and dieters, pork has been coming around as a healthier alternative of late—as long as you choose the right cut. Your best bet is pork tenderloin: A University of Wisconsin Study found that a three-ounce serving of pork tenderloin has slightly less fat than a skinless chicken breast.</p>
				<p>It has 24 grams of protein per serving and 83 milligrams of waist-whittling choline (in the latter case, about the same as a medium egg). In a study published in the journal Nutrients, scientists asked 144 overweight people to eat a diet rich in fresh lean pork. After three months, the group saw a significant reduction in waist size, BMI and belly fat, with no reduction in muscle mass! They speculate that the amino acid profile of pork protein may contribute to greater fat burning.</p>
				<p><strong>8. Millet</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-8.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Millet may be the main ingredient in birdseed, but this lesser-known health food shouldn't be limited to Mr. Bluebird on your shoulder. Although technically a seed, millet should be treated as a grain. It helps enhance blood flow to your muscles thanks to its rich magnesium content, allowing them to develop and take on a more jacked look.</p>
				<p>Even better, this seed has the power to strengthen your body and give your muscles long-lasting fuel because it's a great source of plant-based protein and complex carbohydrates. Interested in trying it out? Great! We suggest using it just as you would quinoa—in salads, sides and breakfast bowls.</p>
				<p><strong>9. Chia Seeds</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-9.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>They may be tiny, but chia seeds have massive health benefits and plenty of muscle-chiseling power. Their greatest strength as a better-body ally comes from the one-two punch they deliver of omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. Healthy omega-3s work to reduce inflammation and help strengthen and grow your muscles through the process of protein synthesis, while fiber supplies you with steady, long-burning energy. In fact, just two tablespoons of the seeds contain 11 grams of gut-filling fiber. Add the stuff to oats, smoothies, and salad dressings to reap the benefits.</p>
				<p><strong>10. Cottage Cheese</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/3-10.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Cottage cheese's muscle-building powers come from two different components: casein (the slow-digesting dairy protein) and live cultures. When you eat casein, your blood amino acid levels rise slowly and stay elevated for longer than if you would have eaten whey. The live cultures will help you break down and absorb all the nutrients you need to get bigger and stronger. Eat the stuff plain, toss it with some chopped nuts and berries, or mix it with some eggs and chopped veggies for an extra protein-packed frittata.
