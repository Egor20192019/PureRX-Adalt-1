                <h1><strong>Foods For Your Heart</strong></h1>
                <div><img src="images/Log-2.png" alt=""></div>
				<p>Get this: More than one in four adult men, or more than 25 percent, will die of cardiovascular disease, according to the CDC. And one in every four male deaths is a result of heart disease. Those are seriously scary stats! Paired with a sensible diet and consistent routine exercise, the foods below can help ward off high blood pressure, stroke, high cholesterol, and heart disease.</p>
				<p><strong>1. Wild Salmon</strong></p>

                  <div><img src="images/2-1.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Whether you're simply trying to stay healthy or trying to improve your heart health because you're already suffering from heart disease, omega-3s can help, say the experts at the National Institute of Health. How? The healthy fat helps reduce triglycerides (the fats that can build up in your blood and cause a heart attack) and also diminish the risk of an irregular heartbeat. To reap the benefits, pick wild over farmed and check out these healthy salmon recipes.</p>
				<p><strong>2. Flax Seeds</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-2.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>A diet of heart-healthy fats, like those found in flax seeds, raises good HDL cholesterol levels. Plus the seed, which can be added to everything from smoothies to cereal, contains a huge dose of heart-protecting fiber as well. Use ground seeds to maximize your omega-3 intake.</p>
				<p><strong>3 & 4. Beans & Legumes</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-3_4.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Unlike animal sources of protein, beans and legumes are free of unhealthy fats. That might be the very reason one study found that people who consumed legumes at least four times a week had a 22 percent lower risk of heart disease compared with those who consumed them less than once a week. (If they were eating more beans, that likely meant they were eating less meat.)</p>
				<p>Equally as encouraging results were published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. A scientific review of 26 clinical trials discovered that eating a three-quarter cup of beans daily could reduce levels of "bad" cholesterol in the blood by five percent. Add beans to your salads, soups, and guac (another heart-healthy food!) to reap the benefits. We're also fans of Roots Black Bean Hummus. It makes a great veggie stick dipper and sandwich spread.</p>
				<p><strong>5. Walnuts</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-5.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>

				<p>The genus name for walnuts comes from the Roman phrase Jupiter glans, or "Jupiter's acorn," which shows you just how godly the Romans believed the nut to be. And still today, the meaty walnut is highly regarded for its nutritional awesomeness. As one of the best dietary sources of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, walnuts have proven particularly good for the heart.</p>
				<p>One study showed a two-ounce daily snack was enough to significantly improve blood flow to and from the heart. And a second Journal of the American College of Cardiology study of over 76,000 women found that eating a one-ounce portion of walnuts once or more a week was associated with up to a 19 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Sounds like a great reason to chow down, if you ask us.</p>
				<p>It's important to note that high temperatures can destroy walnuts' volatile oils while prolonged exposure to air can cause the nuts to become rancid. Buy walnuts raw and store them in an airtight container in the fridge for a heart-healthy snack that loves you back.</p>
				<p><strong>6. Avocados</strong></p>

				<p>Good news, guacamole lovers! Thanks to its high monounsaturated fat content (a nutrient that fights off high cholesterol), your obsession with avocados may just keep your ticker in tip-top health. Check out these avocado recipes for weight loss for culinary inspiration.</p>
				<p><strong>7. Oatmeal</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-7.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Oats are rich in a type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan and the anti-inflammatory compound avenanthramide—which help fight against obesity-related health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. One 10-year study in the American Journal of Public Health found that eating one serving of oatmeal (one cup cooked) two to four times a week resulted in a 16 percent reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
				<p>A bowl five to six days a week showed an even greater risk reduction of 39 percent. And a second study showed that three servings of whole grains per day, including oats, was as effective as medication in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart disease by 15 percent in just 12 weeks. Whip up one of these tasty overnight oats recipes to reap the benefits!</p>
				<p><strong>8. Mushrooms</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-8.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Not only are mushrooms super low-cal, they're a good source of with potassium, a nutrient that can help lower blood pressure and offset the negative effects of excess sodium. Another reason to add the veggie to your shopping list: Researchers at the University of Florida showed increased immunity in people who ate four ounces of cooked mushrooms every day for four weeks.</p>
				<p><strong>9. Olive Oil</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-9.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>The world's first Olympians circa 776 BC were rewarded jugs of olive oil for their athletic feats. And today's health experts consider regular intake of the "liquid gold" equally valuable. Regular intake of virgin olive oil—a healthy fat characteristic of the Mediterranean diet—is associated with low incidences of cancer, heart disease, and other obesity-related problems as well as a lower risk of stroke.</p>
				<p>A recent study in the journal PLOS ONE showed that obese firefighters who adhered to a Mediterranean-style diet rich in olive oil showed a 35 percent decreased risk of metabolic syndrome, as well as a 43 percent lower risk of weight gain. Another reason we love olive oil: Studies show phenols in virgin olive oil can effectively "turn off" genes associated with inflammation seen in metabolic syndrome.</p>
				<p><strong>10. Yogurt</strong></p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/2-10.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""></div>

				<p>A study of more than 2,000 adults revealed that those who consume just two percent of their total daily calories from yogurt have a lower incidence of hypertension than those who eat the creamy stuff less often. And some yogurts also carry a nice dose of potassium, a proven blood pressure reducer. An eight-ounce container of Stonyfield's Organic Smooth & Creamy yogurt, for example, contains up to 14 percent of the day's recommended intake, more than you'd get from a small banana. To get the benefits and tone your body, start your day with one of these best yogurts for weight loss.</p>
